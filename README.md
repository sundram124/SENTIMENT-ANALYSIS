# Sentiment Analysis on Textual Data

## Overview
This project focuses on **performing sentiment analysis** on textual data, such as **tweets, product reviews, or customer feedback**, using **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques**. The goal is to develop a system that can classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, extract meaningful insights, and visualize sentiment trends. The deliverable is a **Jupyter Notebook** that is easy to understand, execute, and modify, making it accessible even for beginners in NLP and machine learning.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning textual data by removing noise, special characters, and stopwords.
- **Tokenization & Normalization**: Splitting text into meaningful tokens and applying stemming/lemmatization.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Using lexicon-based (VADER, TextBlob) and machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes).
- **Model Evaluation**: Checking accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Displaying results using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
- **Ease of Use**: Fully commented code, making it easy to execute and modify.
- **Deployment Ready**: The notebook can be directly used in **VS Code** and Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
The dataset used for sentiment analysis consists of textual data such as:
- **Tweets** about a particular topic.
- **Customer Reviews** from e-commerce platforms.
- **Product Feedback** from survey data.
- **News headlines and articles**.

If you have your own dataset, ensure it is in **CSV format** and update the file path accordingly in the notebook.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3.9**
- **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit)
- **TextBlob** (Lexicon-based sentiment analysis)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine learning models)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Methodology
### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Convert text to lowercase to maintain consistency.
- Remove punctuation and special characters.
- Tokenization â€“ Splitting sentences into individual words.
- Remove stopwords â€“ Eliminating common words (e.g., 'the', 'is', 'and').
- Stemming/Lemmatization â€“ Reducing words to their root form.

### 2. **Sentiment Analysis Approaches**
#### **Lexicon-Based Analysis (VADER & TextBlob)**
- **VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a rule-based tool optimized for social media text.
- **TextBlob** provides a simple API for NLP tasks and assigns a polarity score to each sentence.

#### **Machine Learning-Based Analysis**
We implement supervised learning techniques, including:
- **Naive Bayes Classifier** â€“ A probabilistic classifier that works well for text classification.
- **Logistic Regression** â€“ A simple yet effective model for binary classification.

### 3. **Model Evaluation**
To measure model performance, we use:
- **Accuracy**: Measures how many predictions were correct.
- **Precision & Recall**: Evaluates the balance between false positives and false negatives.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visual representation of true vs. false predictions.

### 4. **Results & Insights**
- **Sentiment Distribution** â€“ Pie charts and bar graphs visualize positive, negative, and neutral sentiment proportions.
- **Time-Based Trends** â€“ Analyzing how sentiment varies over time (if timestamp data is available).
- **Word Cloud** â€“ Displaying most frequently used positive and negative words.

## How to Run the Notebook
1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/sentiment_analysis.git
cd sentiment_analysis
```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
```bash
conda create --name sentiment_analysis python=3.9 -y
conda activate sentiment_analysis
```

3. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open `Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb` and execute the steps.

## Future Enhancements
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implementing LSTMs, BERT, or transformers for better accuracy.
- **Real-Time Sentiment Analysis**: Using APIs to analyze live tweets or news articles.
- **Deployment**: Creating a web app using Flask or FastAPI to make the model accessible.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques** can be applied to **sentiment analysis** in textual data. By leveraging both **lexicon-based methods** and **machine learning algorithms**, we can effectively classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The insights derived from this analysis can be useful for businesses, marketers, and analysts in understanding customer opinions and improving decision-making processes. The structured **Jupyter Notebook** ensures ease of use, reproducibility, and further enhancements for future research.
